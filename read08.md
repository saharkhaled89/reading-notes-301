# Structured Query Language SQL

**What is SQL?**

* SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

**To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.**

# Relational databases

*Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.*


* There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard.

 # Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)

**Now we know how to select for specific columns of data from a table, but if you had a table with a hundred million rows of data, reading through all the rows would be inefficient and perhaps even impossible.**

**In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.**

**More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2). And below are some useful operators that you can use for numerical data (ie. integer or floating point):**

* Operators cheat sheet:

When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. We show a few common text-data specific operators below:

# Filtering and sorting Query results

*Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be â€“ take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year. In such cases, SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.*
